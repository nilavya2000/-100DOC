#  I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.
## Rules
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day!
3. Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
4. Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. 
5. It's a great way to keep    yourself motivated and to participate in the community.
## Want to change other habits?
 Check out the #100DaysOfX Challenges Project. Changing your habits you are changing your life. Remember that the best time to   start is always NOW.
 I recommend that you commit to no more than 2-3 challenges at a time, ideally 2. If you are doing the #100DaysOfCode which       involves a lot of mental activity, try the #100DaysOfHealth, or #100DaysOfFitness challenges. There is so much more on the     site, check all of them out and choose the ones you want to acquire! Languages, writing, meditation, journaling, cooking, and   more!
