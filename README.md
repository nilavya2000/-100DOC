#  I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.
## Rules
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day!
3. Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
4. Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. 
5. It's a great way to keep    yourself motivated and to participate in the community.
